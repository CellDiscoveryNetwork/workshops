	abstract = {The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

	abstract = {The development of John Aitchison's approach to compositional data analysis is followed since his paper read to the Royal Statistical Society in 1982. Aitchison's logratio approach, which was proposed to solve the problematic aspects of working with data with a fixed sum constraint, is summarized and reappraised. It is maintained that the properties on which this approach was originally built, the main one being subcompositional coherence, are not required to be satisfied exactly -- quasi-coherence is sufficient, that is near enough to being coherent for all practical purposes. This opens up the field to using simpler data transformations, such as power transformations, that permit zero values in the data. The additional property of exact isometry, which was subsequently introduced and not in Aitchison's original conception, imposed the use of isometric logratio transformations, but these are complicated and problematic to interpret, involving ratios of geometric means. If this property is regarded as important in certain analytical contexts, for example unsupervised learning, it can be relaxed by showing that regular pairwise logratios, as well as the alternative quasi-coherent transformations, can also be quasi-isometric, meaning they are close enough to exact isometry for all practical purposes. It is concluded that the isometric and related logratio transformations such as pivot logratios are not a prerequisite for good practice, although many authors insist on their obligatory use. This conclusion is fully supported here by case studies in geochemistry and in genomics, where the good performance is demonstrated of pairwise logratios, as originally proposed by Aitchison, or Box-Cox power transforms of the original compositions where no zero replacements are necessary.},
