	abstract = {Among existing computational algorithms for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, clustering and trajectory inference are two major types of analysis that are routinely applied. For a given dataset, clustering and trajectory inference can generate vastly different visualizations that lead to very different interpretations of the data. To address this issue, we propose multiple scores to quantify the “clusterness” and “trajectoriness” of single-cell RNA-seq data, in other words, whether the data looks like a collection of distinct clusters or a continuum of progression trajectory. The scores we introduce are based on pairwise distance distribution, persistent homology, vector magnitude, Ripley’s K, and degrees of connectivity. Using simulated datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed scores are able to effectively differentiate between cluster-like data and trajectory-like data. Using real single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate the scores can serve as indicators of whether clustering analysis or trajectory inference is a more appropriate choice for biological interpretation of the data.},

	abstract = {Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) commonly treated through anti-TNF blockade. However, most patients still relapse and inevitably progress. Comprehensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlases have largely sampled patients with established treatment-refractory IBD, limiting our understanding of which cell types, subsets, and states at diagnosis anticipate disease severity and response to treatment. Here, through combining clinical, flow cytometry, histology, and scRNA-seq methods, we profile diagnostic human biopsies from the terminal ileum of treatment-naïve pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease (pediCD; n=14), matched repeat biopsies (pediCD-treated; n=8) and from non-inflamed pediatric controls with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID; n=13). To resolve and annotate epithelial, stromal, and immune cell states among the 201,883 baseline single-cell transcriptomes, we develop a principled and unbiased tiered clustering approach, ARBOL. Through flow cytometry and scRNA-seq, we observe that treatment-naïve pediCD and FGID have similar broad cell type composition. However, through high-resolution scRNA-seq analysis and microscopy, we identify significant differences in cell subsets and states that arise during pediCD relative to FGID. By closely linking our scRNA-seq analysis with clinical meta-data, we resolve a vector of T cell, innate lymphocyte, myeloid, and epithelial cell states in treatment-naïve pediCD (pediCD-TIME) samples which can distinguish patients along the trajectory of disease severity and anti-TNF response. By using ARBOL with integration, we position repeat on-treatment biopsies from our patients between treatment-naïve pediCD and on-treatment adult CD. We identify that anti-TNF treatment pushes the pediatric cellular ecosystem towards an adult, more treatment-refractory state. Our study jointly leverages a treatment-naïve cohort, high-resolution principled scRNA-seq data analysis, and clinical outcomes to understand which baseline cell states may predict Crohn’s disease trajectory.},
