	abstract = {The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

	abstract = {The development of John Aitchison's approach to compositional data analysis is followed since his paper read to the Royal Statistical Society in 1982. Aitchison's logratio approach, which was proposed to solve the problematic aspects of working with data with a fixed sum constraint, is summarized and reappraised. It is maintained that the properties on which this approach was originally built, the main one being subcompositional coherence, are not required to be satisfied exactly -- quasi-coherence is sufficient, that is near enough to being coherent for all practical purposes. This opens up the field to using simpler data transformations, such as power transformations, that permit zero values in the data. The additional property of exact isometry, which was subsequently introduced and not in Aitchison's original conception, imposed the use of isometric logratio transformations, but these are complicated and problematic to interpret, involving ratios of geometric means. If this property is regarded as important in certain analytical contexts, for example unsupervised learning, it can be relaxed by showing that regular pairwise logratios, as well as the alternative quasi-coherent transformations, can also be quasi-isometric, meaning they are close enough to exact isometry for all practical purposes. It is concluded that the isometric and related logratio transformations such as pivot logratios are not a prerequisite for good practice, although many authors insist on their obligatory use. This conclusion is fully supported here by case studies in geochemistry and in genomics, where the good performance is demonstrated of pairwise logratios, as originally proposed by Aitchison, or Box-Cox power transforms of the original compositions where no zero replacements are necessary.},

	abstract = {Differential abundance analysis is controversial throughout microbiome research. Gold standard approaches require laborious measurements of total microbial load, or absolute number of microorganisms, to accurately determine taxonomic shifts. Therefore, most studies rely on relative abundance data. Here, we demonstrate common pitfalls in comparing relative abundance across samples and identify two solutions that reveal microbial changes without the need to estimate total microbial load. We define the notion of “reference frames”, which provide deep intuition about the compositional nature of microbiome data. In an oral time series experiment, reference frames alleviate false positives and produce consistent results on both raw and cell-count normalized data. Furthermore, reference frames identify consistent, differentially abundant microbes previously undetected in two independent published datasets from subjects with atopic dermatitis. These methods allow reassessment of published relative abundance data to reveal reproducible microbial changes from standard sequencing output without the need for new assays.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) assays are being increasingly utilized to investigate specific hypotheses in both basic biology and clinically-applied studies. The design of most such studies can be often reduced to a comparison between two or more groups of samples, such as disease cases and healthy controls, or treatment and placebo. Comparative analysis between groups of scRNA-seq samples brings additional statistical considerations, and currently there is a lack of tools to address this common scenario. Based on our experience with comparative designs, here we present a computational suite (Cacoa – case-control analysis) to carry out statistical tests, exploration, and visualization of scRNA-seq sample cohorts. Using multiple example datasets, we demonstrate how application of these techniques can provide additional insights, and avoid issues stemming from inter-individual variability, limited sample size, and high dimensionality of the data.},

	abstract = {This contribution presents a new R package, called “compositions”. It provides tools to analyze amount or compositional data sets in four different geometries, each one associated with an R class: rplus (for amounts, or open compositions, in a real, classical geometry), aplus (for amounts in a logarithmic geometry), rcomp (for closed compositions in a real geometry) and acomp (for closed compositions in a logistic geometry, following a log-ratio approach). The package allows to compare results obtained with these four approaches, since an analogous analysis can be performed according to each geometry, with minimal and straightforward modifications of the instructions. Beside these grounding classes, the package also includes: the most-basic features such as data transformations (e.g.logarithm, or additive logistic transform), basic statistics (both the classical ones, and those developed in the log-ratio framework of compositional analysis), high-level graphics (like ternary diagram matrix and scatter-plots) and high-level analysis (e.g.principal components or cluster analysis). Results of these functions and analysis are also provided in a consistent way among the four geometries, to ease their comparison.},

	abstract = {Cellular omics such as single-cell genomics, proteomics, and microbiomics allow the characterization of tissue and microbial community composition, which can be compared between conditions to identify biological drivers. This strategy has been critical to revealing markers of disease progression, such as cancer and pathogen infection. A dedicated statistical method for differential variability analysis is lacking for cellular omics data, and existing methods for differential composition analysis do not model some compositional data properties, suggesting there is room to improve model performance. Here, we introduce sccomp, a method for differential composition and variability analyses that jointly models data count distribution, compositionality, group-specific variability, and proportion mean–variability association, being aware of outliers. sccomp provides a comprehensive analysis framework that offers realistic data simulation and cross-study knowledge transfer. Here, we demonstrate that mean–variability association is ubiquitous across technologies, highlighting the inadequacy of the very popular Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. We show that sccomp accurately fits experimental data, significantly improving performance over state-of-the-art algorithms. Using sccomp, we identified differential constraints and composition in the microenvironment of primary breast cancer.},
