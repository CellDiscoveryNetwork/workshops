	abstract = {The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

	abstract = {The development of John Aitchison's approach to compositional data analysis is followed since his paper read to the Royal Statistical Society in 1982. Aitchison's logratio approach, which was proposed to solve the problematic aspects of working with data with a fixed sum constraint, is summarized and reappraised. It is maintained that the properties on which this approach was originally built, the main one being subcompositional coherence, are not required to be satisfied exactly -- quasi-coherence is sufficient, that is near enough to being coherent for all practical purposes. This opens up the field to using simpler data transformations, such as power transformations, that permit zero values in the data. The additional property of exact isometry, which was subsequently introduced and not in Aitchison's original conception, imposed the use of isometric logratio transformations, but these are complicated and problematic to interpret, involving ratios of geometric means. If this property is regarded as important in certain analytical contexts, for example unsupervised learning, it can be relaxed by showing that regular pairwise logratios, as well as the alternative quasi-coherent transformations, can also be quasi-isometric, meaning they are close enough to exact isometry for all practical purposes. It is concluded that the isometric and related logratio transformations such as pivot logratios are not a prerequisite for good practice, although many authors insist on their obligatory use. This conclusion is fully supported here by case studies in geochemistry and in genomics, where the good performance is demonstrated of pairwise logratios, as originally proposed by Aitchison, or Box-Cox power transforms of the original compositions where no zero replacements are necessary.},

	abstract = {Differential abundance analysis is controversial throughout microbiome research. Gold standard approaches require laborious measurements of total microbial load, or absolute number of microorganisms, to accurately determine taxonomic shifts. Therefore, most studies rely on relative abundance data. Here, we demonstrate common pitfalls in comparing relative abundance across samples and identify two solutions that reveal microbial changes without the need to estimate total microbial load. We define the notion of “reference frames”, which provide deep intuition about the compositional nature of microbiome data. In an oral time series experiment, reference frames alleviate false positives and produce consistent results on both raw and cell-count normalized data. Furthermore, reference frames identify consistent, differentially abundant microbes previously undetected in two independent published datasets from subjects with atopic dermatitis. These methods allow reassessment of published relative abundance data to reveal reproducible microbial changes from standard sequencing output without the need for new assays.},

The design of most such studies can be often reduced to a comparison between two or more groups of samples, such as disease cases and healthy controls, or treatment and placebo. Comparative analysis between groups of scRNA-seq samples brings additional statistical considerations, and currently there is a lack of tools to address this common scenario. Based on our experience with comparative designs, here we present a computational suite (Cacoa – case-control analysis) to carry out statistical tests, exploration, and visualization of scRNA-seq sample cohorts. Using multiple example datasets, we demonstrate how application of these techniques can provide additional insights, and avoid issues stemming from inter-individual variability, limited sample size, and high dimensionality of the data.},

The package allows to compare results obtained with these four approaches, since an analogous analysis can be performed according to each geometry, with minimal and straightforward modifications of the instructions. Beside these grounding classes, the package also includes: the most-basic features such as data transformations (e.g.logarithm, or additive logistic transform), basic statistics (both the classical ones, and those developed in the log-ratio framework of compositional analysis), high-level graphics (like ternary diagram matrix and scatter-plots) and high-level analysis (e.g.principal components or cluster analysis). Results of these functions and analysis are also provided in a consistent way among the four geometries, to ease their comparison.},

This strategy has been critical to revealing markers of disease progression, such as cancer and pathogen infection. A dedicated statistical method for differential variability analysis is lacking for cellular omics data, and existing methods for differential composition analysis do not model some compositional data properties, suggesting there is room to improve model performance. Here, we introduce sccomp, a method for differential composition and variability analyses that jointly models data count distribution, compositionality, group-specific variability, and proportion mean–variability association, being aware of outliers. sccomp provides a comprehensive analysis framework that offers realistic data simulation and cross-study knowledge transfer. Here, we demonstrate that mean–variability association is ubiquitous across technologies, highlighting the inadequacy of the very popular Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. We show that sccomp accurately fits experimental data, significantly improving performance over state-of-the-art algorithms. Using sccomp, we identified differential constraints and composition in the microenvironment of primary breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) commonly treated through anti-TNF blockade. However, most patients still relapse and inevitably progress. Comprehensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlases have largely sampled patients with established treatment-refractory IBD, limiting our understanding of which cell types, subsets, and states at diagnosis anticipate disease severity and response to treatment. Here, through combining clinical, flow cytometry, histology, and scRNA-seq methods, we profile diagnostic human biopsies from the terminal ileum of treatment-naïve pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease (pediCD; n=14), matched repeat biopsies (pediCD-treated; n=8) and from non-inflamed pediatric controls with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID; n=13). To resolve and annotate epithelial, stromal, and immune cell states among the 201,883 baseline single-cell transcriptomes, we develop a principled and unbiased tiered clustering approach, ARBOL. Through flow cytometry and scRNA-seq, we observe that treatment-naïve pediCD and FGID have similar broad cell type composition. However, through high-resolution scRNA-seq analysis and microscopy, we identify significant differences in cell subsets and states that arise during pediCD relative to FGID. By closely linking our scRNA-seq analysis with clinical meta-data, we resolve a vector of T cell, innate lymphocyte, myeloid, and epithelial cell states in treatment-naïve pediCD (pediCD-TIME) samples which can distinguish patients along the trajectory of disease severity and anti-TNF response. By using ARBOL with integration, we position repeat on-treatment biopsies from our patients between treatment-naïve pediCD and on-treatment adult CD. We identify that anti-TNF treatment pushes the pediatric cellular ecosystem towards an adult, more treatment-refractory state. Our study jointly leverages a treatment-naïve cohort, high-resolution principled scRNA-seq data analysis, and clinical outcomes to understand which baseline cell states may predict Crohn’s disease trajectory.},

Using simulations and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we show that Milo can identify perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters, that it maintains false discovery rate control across batch effects and that it outperforms alternative differential abundance testing strategies. Milo identifies the decline of a fate-biased epithelial precursor in the aging mouse thymus and identifies perturbations to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver. As Milo is based on a cell–cell similarity structure, it might also be applicable to single-cell data other than scRNA-seq.
